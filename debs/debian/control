Description: Apache Flex Messaging
 The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community
 of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized
 by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and pragmatic
 software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads
 the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects
 sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.
